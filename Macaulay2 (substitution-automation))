-- The idea I had is to first denote the eight 3 x 3 matrices from which we will take the determinant to get the polynomial Ï• by M1, M2, 
-- ..., M8. Note that the codes below are not necessarily in order.

M1 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_0}, x_{1i_1}, x_{1i_2}}, {x_{2i_0}, x_{2i_1}, x_{2i_2}}};
M2 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_0}, x_{1i_3}, x_{1i_4}}, {x_{2i_0}, x_{2i_3}, x_{2i_4}}};
M3 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_1}, x_{1i_3}, x_{1i_5}}, {x_{2i_1}, x_{2i_3}, x_{2i_5}}};
M4 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_2}, x_{1i_4}, x_{1i_5}}, {x_{2i_2}, x_{2i_4}, x_{2i_5}}};
M5 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_0}, x_{1i_1}, x_{1i_3}}, {x_{2i_0}, x_{2i_1}, x_{2i_3}}};
M6 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_0}, x_{1i_2}, x_{1i_4}}, {x_{2i_0}, x_{2i_2}, x_{2i_4}}};
M7 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_1}, x_{1i_2}, x_{1i_5}}, {x_{2i_1}, x_{2i_2}, x_{2i_5}}};
M8 = matrix{{1, 1, 1}, {x_{1i_3}, x_{1i_4}, x_{1i_5}}, {x_{2i_3}, x_{2i_4}, x_{2i_5}}};

-- Once we have that, for every subset of order 6 of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, say {a_0, a_1, ..., a_5}, we will need to replace the i_j's by
-- a_j's and compute the determinantal polynomial det(M1)*det(M2)*det(M3)*det(M4)-det(M5)*det(M6)*det(M7)*det(M8), where
-- all matrices M1, M2, ..., M8 had their entries replaced correctly. 

-- subsets(n , 6) gives us all the subsets of order 6 of [n]={0, 1, ..., n-1}
-- We can list the first, the second, and, in general, the n-th element of a subset declared as L by L#0, L#1 and L#{n-1}.

-- First, we get the set containing all the subsets of order 6 of [n]. Then, we somehow need to take each of this elements -
-- which are subsets of [n] - and take their elements. The idea would be to list the elements twice. Example: Suppose we have n=7
-- and the set containing all the subsets of order 6 of [7]. This set will have 7 elements. We take the first element, which is a set,
-- by L#0. Then we have that L#0 is a set and, because of that, we can compute (L#0)#0 to get the first element of this set, (L#0)#1 
-- to get the second, and so on.
