--Okay, so here's what I'm thinking.
--What we want is for each outer loop to generate a new set of weights to run our other program with.
--The inner loop is meant to form individual sets of weights, and the outer loop forms a list of all possible weight sets.
--We can build each weight set by converting i to binary and then listing its digits.
--Unfortunately, I don't think Macaulay has any built-in stuff relating to binary numbers.
--So what we need to do is write something in the body of the inner loop that will add a "1" to the list
--if the binary representation of i has a 1 there and a 0 otherwise.
--I don't know how to do that yet but it seems like we should be able to figure it out today.


for i to (2^{2n}-1) do 
(
    for j from 1 to (2n) do
    (
        if (i%2^j < 2^{j-1})
            add a 0
        else
            add a 1
    )
)



-- We start by defining n. Then we create an empty set S so that we can add elements to it. The next two for loops put
-- n zeros and n ones in S, respectively. Then, we let P be all the permutations of S and then U be the subset of P which
-- contains all combinations of the elements of S but without repeating them.

n=2;
S = {};
for i to n-1 do (S = append(S, 0));
for i to n-1 do (S = append(S, 1));
S
P = permutations S
U = unique(P)
