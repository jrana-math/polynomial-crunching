// Ok, I found out what was going wrong with the above code. Here is the fixed version. I changed the variables x_1, ..., x_6 by a, ..., f
// since I personally think that it makes the code simpler and prevent us from confusing x_1, ..., x_6 with the variables x_11, ..., x_27.
// One of the things that I noted is that declaring a variable by f_1 - instead of, say, f - gives an error in this case(Why?*).
// Also, we should substitute the values of the matrix and then take its determinant instead of doing the other way around, because by 
// doing the latter we would also get an error when doing the substitution. 
//*The reason why this happens is that, when we have a matrix f, by typing f_1 we would actually perform a kind of operation on it in a way
// that would make it a non square matrix (assuming that originally we are working with a square one).
